# Bike Sharing System
---
A **bicycle-sharing system** is a service in which users can rent/use bicycles available for shared use on a short term basis for a price or free. Such systems usually **aim to reduce congestion, noise, and air pollution** by providing free/affordable access to bicycles for short-distance trips in an urban area as opposed to motorized vehicles. The number of users on any given day can vary greatly for such systems. The ability to predict the number of hourly users can allow the entities (businesses/governments) that oversee these systems to manage them in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. Our **goal** is to use and optimize Machine Learning models that effectively **predict the number of ride-sharing bikes that will be used in any given 1 hour time-period,** using available information about that time/day.
